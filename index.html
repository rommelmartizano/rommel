                <p>As a college student, I often found myself grappling with the notorious habit of procrastination. One memorable experience that perfectly encapsulates the highs and lows of student life occurred during a fateful night leading up to a major deadline.

I had a looming research paper deadline scheduled for Friday morning, and I had grand plans to start working on it early in the week. However, as the week progressed, so did my ability to convince myself that I had plenty of time left.</p>
